# CIViC Evidence Export Data Dictionary (Detailed)

| Column | Detailed Description | Key Documentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| evidence_id | Integer primary key assigned to each CIViC Evidence Item (EID). CIViC creates this identifier when a curator submits a new evidence statement, and it persists across moderations, flags, and revisions, allowing other entities (molecular profiles, assertions, activity logs) to reference the same curated unit. | docs.md:291,296 |
| evidence_name | Human-readable label for the evidence item, always rendered as the prefix `EID` plus the numeric identifier (e.g., `EID116`). This name is used throughout the user interface (tables, screenshots, activity feeds) to let curators and consumers reference the evidence without exposing internal IDs. | docs.md:1712 |
| evidence_description | Free-text Evidence Statement curated from primary literature that summarises the clinical relevance of the molecular profile in a defined disease context. Curators are instructed to include study design elements (population, comparator, therapies, statistical outcomes) while avoiding PHI and plagiarism, producing a concise but information-rich synopsis that supports interpretation of the structured fields. | docs.md:994-1013 |
| evidence_level | Categorical variable (A–E) capturing the strength of the study type underpinning the evidence. `A` denotes validated associations (often Phase III trials or guideline-backed standards), `B` large clinical cohorts, `C` case studies/small series, `D` preclinical models, and `E` inferential evidence; these levels contextualise how close the finding is to clinical implementation. | docs.md:1015-1138 |
| evidence_type | Controlled vocabulary indicating the clinical dimension captured by the evidence statement: Predictive (therapy response), Diagnostic (disease classification), Prognostic (outcome correlation), Predisposing (germline risk), Oncogenic (tumorigenic potential), or Functional (molecular impact). The type governs downstream required fields (e.g., therapies for predictive items) and allowable significance values. | docs.md:896-914,317-433 |
| evidence_direction | Indicates whether the cited study supports (`Supports`) or refutes (`Does Not Support`) the stated clinical significance for the molecular profile. Interpretation is type-specific—for example, a predictive item labeled `Does Not Support` denotes lack of response or resistance signal for the therapy under investigation. | docs.md:904-1577 |
| evidence_rating | Curator-assigned trust score on a 1–5 star scale assessing the rigor of the specific evidence statement. Ratings consider sample size, controls, reproducibility, and statistical strength; 5-star items typically stem from well-powered randomized trials whereas 1–2 star items capture preliminary or weakly supported observations. | docs.md:984,1680-1757 |
| evidence_significance | Controlled term describing the clinical effect reported (e.g., `Sensitivity/Response`, `Resistance`, `Positive`, `Poor Outcome`, `Predisposition`, `Oncogenicity`, `Gain of Function`). Available values depend on `evidence_type`, encapsulating how the molecular profile modifies therapy response, diagnostic classification, prognosis, germline risk, somatic oncogenicity, or functional impact. | docs.md:912-1559 |
| evidence_status | Moderation state reflecting where the item sits in the CIViC review workflow: newly submitted items are `submitted`/`unreviewed`, accepted items transition to `accepted`, and rejected submissions carry a rejected status. These states signal whether editors have vetted the statement and align with the yellow vs. green indicators in the interface. | docs.md:296-304 |
| therapy_interaction_type | Specifies how multiple therapies listed in a predictive evidence item relate to each other: `Combination` treatments administered together, `Sequential` therapies given in series, or `Substitutes` representing interchangeable agents within a class. CIViC requires this field whenever more than one therapy is associated with the evidence statement to preserve treatment context. | docs.md:952-1635 |
| variant_origin | Categorizes the presumed origin of the variant within the study cohort—`Somatic`, `Rare Germline`, `Common Germline`, `Combined`, `Mixed`, `Unknown`, or `N/A`. The value guides interpretation by indicating whether findings derive from tumor-acquired events, inherited mutations, mixed populations, or contexts (e.g., expression variants) where origin does not apply. | docs.md:1529-1605 |
| molecular_profile_id | Numeric identifier for the Molecular Profile (MP) that the evidence item annotates. MPs represent either a single variant (simple MP) or a Boolean combination of variants (complex MP), enabling evidence to map to multi-variant constellations instead of individual variants alone. | docs.md:243-256,1868-1899 |
| molecular_profile_name | Canonical name assembled from the MP’s constituent gene-variant clauses (e.g., `EGFR L858R AND EGFR T790M`). Names follow CIViC conventions—gene symbol followed by variant descriptor, Boolean connectors (`AND`, `OR`, `AND NOT`) for multi-variant logic—and serve as the display label in browse and gene pages. | docs.md:253-255,1881-1893 |
| molecular_profile_score | Automatically calculated metric reflecting the total curated evidence supporting the MP. CIViC sums each associated Evidence Item’s score, where an item’s score equals Evidence Level weight (A=10, B=5, C=3, D=1, E=0.5) multiplied by its star rating. Higher scores indicate either more evidence items or stronger underlying studies, but do not resolve conflicting evidence. | docs.md:1949-1964 |
| molecular_profile_is_complex | Boolean flag indicating whether the MP contains two or more component variants. Complex MPs support annotation of combinatorial genotypes (e.g., co-occurring mutations, AND/OR logic), whereas simple MPs comprise a single variant and typically mirror pre-v2 CIViC variant records. | docs.md:246-255,1884-1899 |
| molecular_profile_is_multi_variant | Export-level Boolean indicating whether the named MP references multiple CIViC variant records (e.g., an OR clause spanning several variants). CIViC documentation emphasises simple versus complex MPs but does not separately define this flag; in practice it mirrors whether more than one variant ID contributes to the MP. | docs.md:246-255,1884-1893 |
| molecular_profile_raw_name | Original string entered by the curator when creating the evidence item. CIViC later normalizes names to the canonical `molecular_profile_name`, so this raw form preserves the curator’s initial phrasing and can surface legacy naming patterns for review. | docs.md:253-255 |
| molecular_profile_description | Curator-authored narrative summarising the cumulative clinical relevance of the MP, integrating findings across associated evidence items and citing sources as needed. Descriptions are intended to provide context beyond individual statements, capturing consensus interpretations for the variant combination. | docs.md:1921-1945 |
| molecular_profile_aliases | Set of alternate MP names recorded to reflect synonymous phrasing or equivalent Boolean representations. CIViC advises curators to list intuitive aliases (e.g., reordered clauses, community shorthand) so users can find the MP via varied terminology. | docs.md:1937,1891-1895 |
| variant_ids | Comma-separated CIViC variant identifiers linked to the evidence item via the MP. Each ID corresponds to a curated variant entity that holds nomenclature, coordinate, and ontology metadata. | docs.md:1970-2120 |
| variant_names | Canonical names for the variants participating in the MP. CIViC instructs curators to use the most specific, HGVS-aligned descriptors (e.g., `BRAF V600E`, `EGFR Exon 20 Insertion`) to capture clinically meaningful alterations. | docs.md:2080-2116 |
| variant_aliases | Curated list of alternative variant nomenclature—alternate protein residue numbering, dbSNP/COSMIC IDs, descriptive phrases (e.g., `EXON 12 MUTATION`)—used to ensure search coverage across disparate literature conventions. | docs.md:1989,2486-2493 |
| variant_links | Relative URL path(s) linking to the variant detail page within the CIViC web application. This is export-specific metadata, enabling downstream tooling to reconstruct web links; the core documentation does not define an explicit field. | — |
| variant_single_mp_ids | Identifier(s) for the simple Molecular Profile(s) comprised solely of the given variant. CIViC continues to store these one-variant MPs so evidence can reference either the simple form or a complex MP containing the same variant. | docs.md:246-255 |
| variant_hgvs_descriptions | One or more HGVS-compliant strings (protein, cDNA, genomic) curated to formally describe the variant. CIViC promotes HGVS usage to disambiguate alterations, particularly when multiple genomic changes can yield the same protein effect. | docs.md:731-738,1995 |
| variant_clinvar_ids | ClinVar accession(s) linked to the variant record. Values include explicit IDs where available and controlled placeholders like `None Specified`, `None Found`, or `N/A` when ClinVar evaluation is absent or inapplicable (e.g., expression variants). | docs.md:2001-2004 |
| variant_allele_registry_ids | ClinGen Allele Registry identifiers (CA IDs) automatically generated from the curated representative coordinates. They provide stable cross-database references and enable programmatic lookups for additional annotations (e.g., gnomAD frequency). | docs.md:2007-2012 |

| gene_entrez_ids | Numerical Entrez Gene identifiers attached to each gene feature, allowing unambiguous linkage to NCBI gene records and enabling automated enrichment with mygene.info. | docs.md:235 |
| fusion_five_prime_gene_names | For fusion variants, lists the gene(s) at the 5′ end of the transcript. CIViC enforces 5′→3′ ordering when naming fusions, so this field captures the upstream partner used in variant nomenclature and coordinate assignments. | docs.md:2890-2898 |
| fusion_three_prime_gene_names | Gene(s) at the 3′ end of a fusion variant, typically hosting the functional domain of interest (e.g., kinase domain). CIViC stores them separately to support coordinate tracking and nomenclature conventions. | docs.md:2890-2898 |
| fusion_five_prime_partner_statuses | Export metadata capturing curation status or presence/absence indicators for the 5′ fusion partner. The official documentation describes fusion nomenclature but does not enumerate this status flag. | — |
| fusion_three_prime_partner_statuses | Companion export flag for the 3′ fusion partner, typically indicating whether the partner gene assignment is complete or has special annotations. Not explicitly defined in docs.md. | — |
| factor_ncit_ids | Optional NCIt identifiers for factors captured during export (e.g., biomarkers or experimental conditions linked to the variant). This attribute is not elaborated in docs.md and may reflect extended API output. | — |
| variant_type_names | Sequence Ontology term(s) describing the variant’s structural class (e.g., `Exon Variant`, `Missense Variant`, `Transcript Fusion`). CIViC requires curators to choose the most specific applicable term on a branch to characterise the alteration. | docs.md:2019-2120 |

| chromosome | Chromosome identifier for the representative coordinates of the variant (1-based human genome). CIViC prefers GRCh37 and records the chromosome housing the reference locus. | docs.md:2027-2043,2864-2920 |
| start_position | 1-based genomic start coordinate for the representative variant instance, chosen using left-shifted normalization where applicable to capture the most recurrent or illustrative alteration. | docs.md:2045-2055,2864-2919 |
| stop_position | 1-based genomic end coordinate corresponding to the final base impacted by the representative alteration; for SNV this equals the start position, whereas for indels it spans the deleted/insertion segment per HGVS conventions. | docs.md:2045-2055,2864-2919 |
| coordinate_type | Label describing which coordinate set is provided (e.g., `GENE_VARIANT_COORDINATE`). While docs.md details primary vs. secondary coordinates for variants, this exported string encodes the same context for downstream parsing. | docs.md:2025-2070 |
| reference_build | Human genome assembly used for the representative coordinates, typically `GRCh37` (Ensembl v75) per CIViC’s standardization guidance. | docs.md:2027,2864-2919 |
| representative_transcript | Ensembl transcript ID with version (e.g., `ENST00000263967.3`) selected to express the variant at the transcript level. CIViC advises choosing transcripts that contain the variant, align with MANE Select where possible, and reflect widely used or canonical isoforms. | docs.md:2057-2070,2864-2919 |
| reference_bases | Nucleotide sequence present in the reference genome at the curated locus, recorded to support HGVS-compliant representations and integration with external registries. | docs.md:2051,2864-2919 |
